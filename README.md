## Introduction  

"Celi" originates from the English word "Element" which is the translation of the Hilichurl(Tcho-Tcho) language dictionary in "Genshin Impact".  
"celi" is a compound word consisting of "cell" and"eli". "cell" in English refers to cells, which constitute the basic unit of life; And "eli" is an abbreviation of the English word"elementary", which means basic and elementary. Therefore, the name "celi" can be understood as a basic element or a primary basic structure that forms the basis of living things. This name implies that this large language model has the basic elements that constitute language and the ability to handle basic language structures.——Explanation from ERNIE Bot.
